This dataset is manually collected from observations. It helps us to build machine learning models to predict the quality of milk.
This dataset consists of 7 independent variables ie pH, Temperature, Taste, Odor, Fat, Turbidity, and Color.
Generally, the Grade or Quality of the milk depends on these parameters. These parameters play a vital role in the predictive analysis of the milk.
