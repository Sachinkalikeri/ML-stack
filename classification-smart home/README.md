smart home systems and eventually, I would like to build my own. I noticed that it's hard to find a decent dataset with all sorts of commands so I build my own tiny dataset that I could start with just for fun.

Columns
Number (index)
Category (main category)
Action_needed (action needed or not)
Question (question or not)
Subcategory (the subcategory)
Action (the action that needs to be taken)
Time (the timeframe it needs to be done)
Sentence (the sentence itself)
