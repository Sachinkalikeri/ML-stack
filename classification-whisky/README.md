data preprocessing in this project is to analyze a whisky dataset, detect anomalies, and identify patterns. The dataset contains various characteristics of whiskies, and the goal is to preprocess the data by handling missing values, exploring the distribution of numerical columns, and visualizing geographical information. Additionally, a function needs to be created to recommend similar whiskies based on specified characteristics.
