The goal of this classification problem is to predict whether a user will make a purchase based on their age and estimated salary. The dataset contains information about users' age, estimated salary, and their purchase history. We aim to build a classification model using logistic regression and decision tree algorithms to accurately classify users as purchasers or non-purchasers based on their age and estimated salary. The model's performance will be evaluated using accuracy as the evaluation metric.
