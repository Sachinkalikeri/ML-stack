THis dataset provided is not performing any classification task. It is primarily focused on data analysis and visualization of the World Happiness dataset. The code loads the dataset, performs data cleaning by removing missing values, adds additional columns for region and income group based on external datasets, and then visualizes the relationships between various factors (such as GDP per capita, social support, etc.) and the happiness score.
I needed this dataset to map some countries in the analysis: Advanced Global Warming Analysis with Plotly. Feel free to use this mapping for whatever cool analysis you're doing.
