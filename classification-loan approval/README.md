The task is to predict loan approval status based on various features of clients, such as gender, marital status, employment, income, and credit history.
The dataset consists of client information, including categorical and numerical variables.
Missing values are handled by replacing them with appropriate values or imputing the mean.
Categorical variables are encoded using one-hot encoding and ordinal encoding, while the target variable is label encoded.
Classification models, such as K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) and Logistic Regression, are trained to predict the loan approval status, and their performance is evaluated using accuracy and confusion matrix.
